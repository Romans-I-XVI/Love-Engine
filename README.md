# Love-objectHandler

This game is a basic combination of my objectHandler which handles all game objects similar to how Unity or GameMaker would as well as my camera which makes it easy to convert a game that was designed for a specific resolution to Love2D

This also includes an example of ball collisions on a 2D plane as well as a Timer object.
